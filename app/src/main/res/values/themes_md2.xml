    # Theme guide

    This should provide all the information you need to create new !color! themes.

    ## Inheritance

    You might want to inherit default values from "base" theme. You can do so implicitly by just
    writing `<style name="ThemeFoundationMD2.MySuperAwesomeTheme" parent="ThemeFoundationMD2.Default">`.
    With this approach you can only change values you (don't) like - such as `colorPrimary` or
    `colorSecondary`.
    There's also an option to define theme completely from ground up and that's done just by
    omitting `parent="..."`. It will inherit _nothing_ from the base.

    ## Day / Night ? How do I define both in one theme?

    Define Theme here for "Day" theme and in `values-night` directory define theme with same name
    and parent if applicable. The framework will automatically switch between day/night themes based
    on user's requested configuration. (Always light, Always dark, Follow system)

    You might choose to define only "Day" theme with Dark colors to have dark theme regardless.
    That's super lazy approach and is discouraged but the framework permits it. If not inherited
    from default theme, you must define all colors yourself in both day AND night variants.

    ## What to theme

    Generally I'd suggest theming only `colorPrimary`, `colorSecondary` and their variants. Make
    sure that text is readable if displayed on primary or secondary color!

    You can check that very easily by visiting https://www.colorhexa.com/. After you put in your
    color hex, you can scroll down to "Preview" where it will compute whether dark/bright text
    should be displayed on top of it. Then you must edit respective `colorOn...`.

    Also check "Color Blindness Simulator". Primary and secondary colors must not match or be
    similar in type. Text on color must have enough contrast so it can be read by everyone!

    !! Themes that will not satisfy these requirements will be promptly deleted without further
    !! notice. In repeated attempts to push such themes you will be automatically blacklisted.
